Steps for running the application:



-1.	You also need the egit-github project in your eclipse workspace
0.	Since I have the current keys and tokens hard coded for myself, follow "concaveNP" on twitter to see the results
1.	Load the database with the data specified in the "./DB/example_data_used.txt" file.
2.	That creates the "inventory" db with a "publications" collection and "mydb" with a "testData" collection
3.	Modify the project by putting in the keys and tokens in the GistAuthenticaiton and TwitterAuthentication classes with the values specified in other given document
4.	Run the application  (main is in MainApplication)
5.	Enter "inventory" for db
6.	Enter "publications" for collection
7. 	Enter "sales.books.count >= 100"
8.	The connection status field now contains "Current Criteria yeilds: 3 documents"
9.	Click the "Start Data Publish" button.  This is create a thread to uses the search criteria to populate a queue of tweet-able data
10.	Click the "Enable Tweeting" button.  This allows the tweeting thread to tweet any messages waiting in its queue
11.	Tweets will start rolling by in the tweets text area
12.	Click the "Stop Data Publish" button
13.	Modify the fields for: db=mydb, collection=testData, field=x>23
14.	Click the "Start Data Publish" button.
15.	Two more tweets will show their URLs
16.	From twitter (following concaveNP tweets) there will be 5 new tweets with the first 3 being too big and 2 show the document findings
17.	From one of the tweets that contains a link to a Gist file, click the link to open the file
18.	The Gist file will contain all of the search results found for this application session
19. Go easy on the tweets, I just used my twitter account for this.  :)
